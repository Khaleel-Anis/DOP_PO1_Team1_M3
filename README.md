Hello my name is Khaleel

-------- 67 --------

Sixty-seven — a quiet prime,

Unbroken, indivisible by time.

Between the rush of sixty and the calm of seventy,

It lingers — a whisper of destiny.

Neither round nor even, just rare and true,

A number that hums like evening dew.

-Justin



Hello, this is Ye Yint Aung aka YYA.



When the world grows quiet and the sky turns silver, it’s easy to feel small beneath the endless stars. Yet even in the stillness, life hums softly — in the breeze that brushes your skin, in the heartbeat that refuses to fade, in the hope that lingers like morning light. Every calm night is a promise that dawn will return, carrying warmth for those who dare to keep dreaming. - Shein
