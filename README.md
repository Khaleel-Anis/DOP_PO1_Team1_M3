This is a simple repo



Hello my name is Khaleel



new stuff



-------- 67 --------

Sixty-seven — a quiet prime,

Unbroken, indivisible by time.

Between the rush of sixty and the calm of seventy,

It lingers — a whisper of destiny.

Neither round nor even, just rare and true,

A number that hums like evening dew. 

-Justin
